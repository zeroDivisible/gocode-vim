gocode-vim
==========

Fork of [gocode's](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) vim plugin. The way how it's done now makes it a bit hard to use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to manage that one - while if it is in a separate repository, we can just add

```
Bundle 'zeroDivisible/gocode-vim'
```

to ``.vimrc`` and after typing ``:BundleInstall``, we will have that one installed.
